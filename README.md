# Udacity-SQL

In this project we were asked to extract information from the database of the "Chinook music store".
We were supposed to use SQLite, and data was provided from a .db file.

However, I made all querys using mySQL. In order to do so, I created .sql files containing the schemas and data insertion scripts (adapting from a base script created with SQLite export).

Results are presented in "Apresentação".

The SQL querys are in "Projeto Chinook", and they are preceded by some warm up exercises proposed by the course.
